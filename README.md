.Cars Dataset: Data Cleaning and Analysis Instructions.

1. .Q.1 - Data Cleaning (Find and Fill Null Values).:  
   In this step, check the "Cars" dataset for any null or missing values. If any column contains null values, fill those missing values with the mean of that respective column. This ensures the dataset is complete and ready for analysis, preventing any errors due to missing data.

2. .Q.2 - Value Counts (Types of Make and their Occurrences).:  
   Investigate the "Make" column in the cars dataset to identify all the unique types of "Make" present. Then, count how many times each "Make" appears in the dataset. This provides insight into the distribution of car makes and the frequency of each in your data.

3. .Q.3 - Filtering (Records by Origin).:  
   Filter the dataset to show only the cars that originate from either "Asia" or "Europe" as indicated in the "Origin" column. This allows you to focus specifically on vehicles from these two regions, helping to isolate specific car models and manufacturers.

4. .Q.4 - Removing Unwanted Records (Rows with Weight > 4000).:  
   Remove any records (rows) where the value in the "Weight" column exceeds 4000. This helps eliminate potentially irrelevant or erroneous data, such as outliers, which could distort your analysis or insights.

5. .Q.5 - Applying a Function on a Column (Increase MPG_City by 3).:  
   Apply a transformation to the "MPG_City" column by increasing each value by 3. This could simulate improvements in fuel efficiency or make adjustments based on specific criteria or assumptions you are testing for in your project.

These steps are designed for the .Cars Project., where you will clean, filter, and transform the data to better understand the various car models, their origins, fuel efficiency, and other important characteristics. Following these instructions will help you generate accurate insights for further analysis or reporting.
